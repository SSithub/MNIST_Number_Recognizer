# MNIST_Number_Recognizer
## How to use
When running the jar file, a window should appear and the grey box can be drawn on by clicking and dragging.
The drawing can be cleared by clicking the clear canvas button at the top right.
Below the clear canvas button, there are percentages for numbers 0 to 9.
The percentages are the outputs of the trained model given the current drawing as inputs and are updated constantly.
